# Task-4

A palindrome is a word that reads identically backward or forward.
How an algorithm would determine if a word is a palindrome or not:

For RACECAR
1.Check the number of letters, if even we would need to only look in pairs, if odd we would need to look at pairs and a single letter - odd
2. Check if the first letter and the last letter are the same = so in this case if the first is R and the last is R so - yes
3. are their more letters - yes
4. how many letters are their left -5 
5. Check is the second and secondlast letters are the same = second A and secondlast A so - yes
6. are their more letters - yes
7. how many letters are their left - 3
8. Check if the 3rd and third last letters are the same = third C and third last C - yes
9. are their more letters - yes
10. how many letters are their left - 1
11. If the answer to all question about the letters is yes then the word is a palindrome. - All are yes so this word is a palindrome


For DEFIED
1. Check the number of letters, if even we would need to only look in pairs, if odd we would need to look at pairs and a single letter - even
2. Check if the first letter and the last letter are the same = so in this case if the first is D and the last is D so - yes
3. are their more letters - yes
4. how many letters are their left - 4
5. Check is the second and secondlast letters are the same = second E and secondlast E so - yes
6. are their more letters - yes
7. how many letters are their left - 2
8. Check if the 3rd and third last letters are the same = third F and third last I - no
9. are their more letters - no
11. If the answer to all question about the letters is yes then the word is a palindrome. - not all are yes, no this word is not a palindrome
